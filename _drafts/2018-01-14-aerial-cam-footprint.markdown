Have you ever seen a children's animated tale and thought, "Hmmm, did the artists draw the correct kind of peafowl?"
Well if you haven't get ready for one of the wildest rides of your life.

## Peafowl vs Peacock vs Peahen

Let's start by getting a few semantics out of the way. A peacock is the name given to the male of the peafowl species. Similar to how a bull is a male cattle.
peahen is the female of a species. Lots of other species have similar naming conventions. An example are cattle. The male are called bulls and the females are called cows.
Any animal of the class Aves (birds) use the designation cock and hen.

## Green vs Blue Peafowl
There are a few distinct species of peafowl, the most common being the Indian Peafowl (aka Pavo cristatus, aka Blue Peafowl) and the Green Peafowl (aka Pavo muticus, aka Java Peafowl). In the wild, the Blue peafowl can only be found in Indian and the Green peafowl can primarily be found in Indonesia. The range of the Green Peafowl used to be a lot larger, but hunting and habitat destruction have caused the species to be considered endangered. In the past the Green peafowl had a range that included China.  

## Shen From Kung Fu Panda

In Kung Fu Panda 2 the primary antogonist is a white and red peacock named shen. The movie itself takes place in china so the expectation is that he is a Green Peafowl. Is this actually the case? Let's have a look at Shen first. We can start off by looking at his crest. Here is a primary example of a Green Peafowl.

So from Shen we can see his crest has a more fan like structure and corresponds with the Indian Peafowl. Next piece of evidence is flight. Indian Peafowl are relatively poor at flying. They can fly short distances, mostly to avoid predators but primarily they walk to get to where they want.

In the film Shen, ahs an extended period of flight. That being said it is mostly a glide, but still this is more of characteristic of Green Peafowl. So looking at Shen alone may prove to be somewhat inconclusive, but we briefly see his parents in an opening scene and they can provide us with more information.

## Shen's Parents

First off his father (the one with blue feathers) is indeed blue. His crest also is fanned and he has a very long train (the long tail feathers). If we look at his mother we can see no train. In Indian Peafowl Sexual dimorphisation is quite distinct, especially with the train. Green Peahens and Green Peacocks look very similar and this dimorphisation is not anywhere near as visible. The mother's crest is almost non-existent as well, but here is an example of an Indian peahen almost lacking a crest, just like his mother.


## What does this mean for the Story??
Clearly the story is portraying an Indian Peafowl instead of a Green Peafowl. 
Option 1: The artists did not do there research.
Option 2: The artists did there research but thought Indian Peafowl would be more artistically pleasing.
Option 3: The story actually is some sort of metaphor for the very short lived Indo-Sino War.

Which option is accuracte, that's up to you to decide.
